### Getting started as a technical undergraduate research assistant in SDL

Research at SDL relies on data that must be collected, transformed and analyzed. URAs with technical interests support these efforts.

Members of the Social Dynamics Lab overwhelmingly embrace `Python` as the language of first choice. While we also use other tools like `R`, `Stata`, `C`, `Scala`, `Julia`, and `javascript` where appropriate, most projects are developed in Python. We maintain a python package ecosystem on our lab server, Vesta, for Python versions 2.7 and 3.x. Use Python 3 for new projects. For work on your own machine, we recommend that you use the latest Anaconda Python 3.x distribution.

Anaconda includes the Jupyter notebook server, which provides a cell-based interface to Python. If you don't already have a preferred development environment, Jupyter notebook (along with the `%qtconsole` command) is a good place to start. 

#### Create a github account
We use github to manage and share project related code. It is even more critical since Cornell email started blocking python code attachments. Sign up for an account at [Github](https://github.com/join). Share your account name with your project leader so they can add you to the project (also send your github account name to cjc73@cornell.edu).

#### Install Python

If you have not already done so, please install the Python 3.x version of Anaconda for your platform from [www.continuum.io](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)

#### Get a general purpose text processor

You will benefit from a text processor for inspecting raw data. Here are a few suggestions:

  1. MacOS: BBedit, Atom
  2. Linux: Atom
  3. Windows: Notepad++

#### Review Python Basics

Python has a very good tutorial [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/). Focus on sections: 

  - 3. An Informal Introduction to Python 
  - 4. More Control Flow Tools
  - 5. Data Structures


We encourage good python programming practice to improve readability and reduce errors. Please watch the idiomatic python video linked at [https://gist.github.com/JeffPaine/6213790
](https://gist.github.com/JeffPaine/6213790) and read the code examples.

~Next, register for an Academic License for the Enthought distribution at [https://store.enthought.com/licenses/academic/](https://store.enthought.com/licenses/academic/).~
~We don't use this distribution but they provide students free access to training programs at [https://training.enthought.com](https://training.enthought.com) (note: does not load with Safari browser). I recommend "Tools to Learn and Develop in Python" and "Python Essentials". The first half of the "Advanced Python" series covers techniques we use in the lab (up to Decorators).~

Finally, work through the Pandas tutorial at http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html 

When you complete these steps, you will be ready to start work. (You can visit Enthought's Scipy and Numpy modules and the Pandas resources at http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/tutorials.html as needed after you start working).
